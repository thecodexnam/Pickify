# 🛒 Pickify — Grocery E-Commerce Platform

Pickify is a full-stack grocery e-commerce platform designed to make everyday grocery shopping simpler, faster, and more affordable. The platform allows users to browse grocery items, place online orders, and choose between **Home Delivery** and **Self-Pickup** options — enabling customers to save delivery charges when needed.

This project focuses on smart shopping convenience and cost efficiency, especially in cases where delivery fees increase the final bill. With Pickify, users can simply order through the website (or phone) and pick up their groceries directly from the store at the same price — making the experience both budget-friendly and seamless.
